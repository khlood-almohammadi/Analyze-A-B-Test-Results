# Analyze A / B test results :

A / B tests are commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some training in dealing with the difficulties you are facing.

# For this project :
we will be working to understand the results of an A / B test administered by an e-commerce site. The company has developed a new webpage to try to increase the number of users who "convert", that is, the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand whether they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or maybe run the experiment for a longer period to make their decision.
